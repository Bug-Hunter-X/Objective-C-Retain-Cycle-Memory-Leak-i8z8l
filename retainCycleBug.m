In Objective-C, a common yet subtle issue arises when dealing with memory management, specifically with regards to object ownership and the potential for retain cycles.  Consider this scenario:

```objectivec
@interface MyClass : NSObject
@property (nonatomic, strong) AnotherClass *anotherObject;
@end

@implementation MyClass
// ...
@end

@interface AnotherClass : NSObject
@property (nonatomic, strong) MyClass *myObject;
@end

@implementation AnotherClass
// ...
@end
```

If `MyClass` holds a strong reference to `AnotherClass` and `AnotherClass` simultaneously holds a strong reference back to `MyClass`, a retain cycle is created. Neither object can be deallocated because each is preventing the other from being released. This leads to memory leaks, and eventually, performance degradation or crashes.
